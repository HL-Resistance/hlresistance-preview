## Table of contents

## Get started

First of all, download the [GitAhead client](https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/) and login with your GitHub account. A lot of useful links are pinned in the Discord channel or can be found in [#6](https://github.com/HL-Resistance/hlresistance-preview.github.io/issues/6).

## GitHub
